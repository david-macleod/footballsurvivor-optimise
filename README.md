Optimising picks for footballsurvivor.co.uk competition using linear sum assignment

### Game rules
Pick a Premier League team each week that you expect to win their match. Start the season with 10 lives:

* If team wins: lose 0 lives
* If team draws: lose 1 life
* If team loses: lose 2 lives

**You can only pick each team once during the course of the season**

If you run out of lives, you lose. If you survive, the winner is the person with the most remaining lives.
